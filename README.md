#Project Odin

## This is a collection of excercises from Project Odin 

I'm working through these as I complete the Ruby💎 tutorials on Project Odin.  My hope is to get a better foundation in Ruby to be more efficient  as a rails developer.

Please feel free to open issues or contact me if you see a better way of doing something I want to learn this stuff really well.

Thanks, 
Travis F 🐳
